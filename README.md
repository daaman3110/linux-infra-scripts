# Linux Infra Scripts

This repository contains a collection of real-world Bash scripts I wrote while learning and practicing Linux system administration and DevOps concepts.

These scripts simulate problems faced by SREs, backend engineers, and system administrators at scale â€” like CPU spikes, disk full conditions, service downtime, log bloating, and user management issues.

> uilt as part of my **6-month Infra Builder Roadmap**.
